 # Fibonacci 

 ## A complex exercise on a full-stack App using:
 ### Docker | redis | nginx |postgres

 #### The App just calculates the fibonacci result of the number given in input. To check how it works, clone the repo, write in terminal, in the "complex" directory: docker-compose up --build then navigate in your browser to http://localhost:3050, write a number between 1 and 40, click submit and refresh the page to see the result.

 # Fibonacci 

 ## A complex exercise on a full-stack App using:
 ### Docker | redis | nginx |postgres

 #### The App just calculates the fibonacci result of the number given in input. To check how it works, write in terminal, in the "complex" directory: docker-compose up --build then navigate on http://localhost:3050
